* I am now a PhD candidate at the [Multimedia Computing Group](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en), working with [Dr. Julián Urbano](https://julian-urbano.info) and [Prof. Alan Hanjalic](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/multimedia-computing/people/alan-hanjalic/). My primary research goal is to provide fast, accurate, satisfying, and convincing recommendations to people in need by creating novel methods and algorithms about user modeling, content analysis and collaborative filtering. I am particularly interested in multi-criteria recommender systems and the application of deep learning in recommender systems. 

* I received my Master's degree with cum laude from [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english), China in 2017. My master thesis was about computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer MR images, supervised by Prof. Wei Lu. Prior to that, I received my  B.E. degree from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), China in 2014 under the supervision of Prof. Huimin Yu and Prof. Huiming Tang.

Miscellaneous
------

During my leisure time, I love traveling and experiencing this amazing world. Up till now I have been to 9 different countries and this number will keep improving. I am also a good badminton and table tennis player. Besides, I am a hard core fan of Manchester United (though I have to say I am disappointed with their recent performance). <font color="#660000">Glory Glory Man United!</font><br />
